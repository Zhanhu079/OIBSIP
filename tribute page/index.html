                    Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, USA. From a young age, Jackson
                    showed immense talent and a passion for music. He began his career as a member of the Jackson 5
                    alongside his older brothers, quickly gaining fame for their Motown hits such as "I Want You Back"
                    and "ABC."

                    In 1971, at the age of 13, Michael launched his solo career with the album "Got to Be There," which
                    included the hit single "Ben." However, it was his 1979 album "Off the Wall" that propelled him to
                    solo stardom, with chart-topping singles like "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You."

                    The 1980s marked the peak of Jackson's career with the release of his album "Thriller" in 1982,
                    which became the best-selling album of all time, producing iconic hits like "Billie Jean," "Beat
                    It," and the title track "Thriller." Jackson's groundbreaking music videos, including the 14-minute
                    mini-movie for "Thriller," revolutionized the music industry and solidified his status as a global
                    superstar.
